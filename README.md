# Overview of Project - Mission to Mars

## Purpose 

The purpose of this project was to create a web app visualizing earthquake data with the use of interactive features. The earthquake data was stored in a GeoJSON file and taken from the U.S. Geographical Survey website. The data was retrieved using a combination of Javascript libraries like D3 and Leaflet. The data was then plotted on Mapbox map through an API. The finalized map has 3 map styles to choose from and 3 map layers that display the fault lines, earthquake locations and major earthquake locations (i.e. greater than a magnitude of 4.5). The markers used to represent the earthquake locations also represent the magnitude of each earthquake through the colour and size of the marker.
